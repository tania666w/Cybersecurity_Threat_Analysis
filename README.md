# Cybersecurity Threat Analysis System

## Introduction
In an increasingly digital world, cybersecurity threats have become a significant concern for individuals, organizations, and governments. The rapid expansion of internet-connected devices and cloud-based systems has made it easier for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities. Organizations are often targeted by malicious actors attempting to breach systems, steal data, or disrupt operations. Consequently, robust threat detection and mitigation mechanisms are essential for maintaining security and reducing risk.
Cybersecurity incidents, such as ransomware attacks, phishing campaigns, and unauthorized system access, have grown in both sophistication and frequency. These threats pose financial, operational, and reputational risks to organizations. According to recent cybersecurity reports, data breaches have led to billions of dollars in damages worldwide, reinforcing the urgent need for automated and intelligent threat detection solutions. While traditional security mechanisms such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems play a crucial role, they are often reactive rather than proactive. The shift toward automated threat intelligence solutions enhances an organization’s ability to predict and mitigate potential cyber threats before they escalate into full-blown security incidents.
This report presents a Cybersecurity Threat Analysis System, a data-driven project designed to monitor, analyze, and predict security threats based on real-time threat intelligence data. The system integrates data from the AbuseIPDB API, processes the retrieved data using Python-based analytical tools, applies machine learning techniques to classify potentially malicious IPs, and provides real-time alerts for high-risk threats. Unlike traditional security measures that primarily focus on preventing known attacks, this system leverages machine learning to analyze emerging threats and detect patterns indicative of suspicious activity.
In developing this system, we emphasize structured software engineering practices, including Agile development, GitHub version control, and systematic evaluation of strengths and limitations to enhance cybersecurity monitoring. The Agile methodology ensures an iterative approach, allowing continuous improvements to the system based on new cybersecurity developments. Additionally, version control through GitHub allows for seamless collaboration, ensuring that changes to the system are tracked and maintained effectively.
The following sections provide a comprehensive analysis of the system, including its features, technical implementation, development approach, and evaluation. By the end of this report, we aim to demonstrate how the Cybersecurity Threat Analysis System serves as an essential tool for mitigating cybersecurity risks, improving proactive defense mechanisms, and advancing security operations.

## System Features and Implementation
The Cybersecurity Threat Analysis System is designed to facilitate automated monitoring of security threats. The system collects live threat intelligence from the AbuseIPDB API, a widely used database for tracking malicious IP addresses. The data is processed and analyzed using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to generate meaningful insights and visualizations that can aid security teams in understanding trends in cyber threats. Machine learning is applied through a Random Forest Classifier, which predicts the likelihood of an IP being malicious based on historical threat reports. The system is also equipped with an automated alerting mechanism that notifies security administrators when a high-risk IP is detected. The processed data is stored and exported to Google Drive for future review and analysis. The entire development process is managed using GitHub, ensuring structured version control and project tracking.

## Technical Implementation
The system was built using Python and executed within a Jupyter Notebook environment via Google Colab to ensure accessibility and ease of use. API integration was implemented using Python’s Requests library to fetch data from the AbuseIPDB API. The retrieved data is stored in Pandas DataFrames, which enable efficient data handling and processing. Seaborn and Matplotlib are used to create statistical charts and reports to illustrate cybersecurity threat trends. Machine learning is integrated using Scikit-learn, where a Random Forest Classifier is trained to predict potential security risks based on reported abuse history. The system also includes an email alerting function configured using SMTP, allowing security teams to receive notifications in real time when a high-risk threat is detected.

## Email Alerting Configuration
The system includes a real-time email alerting feature that sends notifications when high-risk threats are detected. To enable this feature, users need to configure their email credentials within the system. The email alerting function uses SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) to send notifications. Users must provide a valid sender email address, a recipient email, and an SMTP server configuration.
To configure email alerts, users must update the following details in the script:
-	Sender Email: A valid email address (e.g., your_email@gmail.com)
-	Recipient Email: The email address that will receive the alerts
-	SMTP Server: SMTP settings of the email provider (e.g., smtp.gmail.com for Gmail)
-	App Password: If using Gmail, users need to generate an App Password from their Google Account settings, as regular passwords are not supported for SMTP authentication.
  
Example configuration in the script:
sender = "your_email@gmail.com"
recipient = "recipient_email@gmail.com"
password = "your_app_password"

Users should ensure that their email provider allows SMTP access and has enabled "Less Secure Apps" or App Password authentication if required. Without proper configuration, email alerts will fail, and users may receive an authentication error.

## Minimal Viable Product (MVP) Development Process
The development of this system followed an iterative process to gradually build and refine a minimal viable product (MVP). The initial phase focused on defining the key functionalities required for a working prototype. The first step involved integrating the AbuseIPDB API to retrieve threat data in real time. Once API calls were successfully fetching data, the next step was structuring this data using Pandas and applying preliminary analysis to identify patterns in abuse confidence scores and total reports. After establishing a foundational dataset, the focus shifted to visualization, ensuring that users could derive insights from the retrieved data efficiently.
Following the successful implementation of data retrieval and visualization, machine learning was introduced to enhance the system’s predictive capabilities. The Random Forest Classifier was trained using existing abuse confidence scores to predict the likelihood of an IP being a security risk. Initially, the model was tested with a limited dataset to fine-tune its parameters before scaling up with more data. Performance evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall were analyzed to assess the model’s effectiveness. The final component added to the MVP was the email alerting system, which enabled real-time notifications when high-risk IPs were detected. By implementing these features in phases, the MVP provided a functional cybersecurity threat analysis tool that could be improved and expanded upon in future iterations.

## Project Planning and Agile Methodology
The project followed an Agile development methodology to ensure iterative progress and continuous improvements. The GitHub Projects tool was used to manage the workflow. The first sprint involved researching cybersecurity intelligence sources, selecting an API, and setting up the initial project environment. The second sprint focused on developing the Jupyter Notebook scripts necessary for retrieving and visualizing threat data. The third sprint involved implementing and testing the machine learning model for automated threat classification. The final sprint covered system evaluation, optimization, documentation, and submission preparation. Each major feature was tracked through GitHub Issues, ensuring proper version control and facilitating smooth development. Regular code commits and pull requests ensured that the repository maintained a structured and logical development history.
To ensure a structured and well-documented approach to project tracking, a combination of GitHub Issues and GitHub Projects was used. GitHub Issues were utilized to document individual tasks, feature requests, and bug reports, while GitHub Projects allowed for a visual representation of the project's progress through a kanban-style board. Given that my organization primarily uses Jira for Agile sprint planning, I duplicated these issues in Jira to compare the functionalities of both platforms. This allowed me to assess GitHub Projects' effectiveness as a task management tool in a real-world scenario, identifying its strengths and limitations compared to Jira. While Jira offers more robust integrations and reporting tools, I found GitHub Projects to be a lightweight, efficient alternative for managing software development workflows within GitHub itself. The comparison provided valuable insights into how different platforms can be leveraged based on project needs and team preferences.

## Running the Cybersecurity Threat Analysis System
To run the project in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook, users must download the cybersecurity_data_product.ipynb file from the public GitHub repository link: Cybersecurity Threat Analysis GitHub Repository and open it in their preferred environment. To install the required dependencies, users should run the command !pip install requests pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn to ensure that all necessary Python packages are available. Before execution, users must configure an AbuseIPDB API key, which can be obtained from the AbuseIPDB API Dashboard. This key should be entered into the script to enable real-time threat intelligence retrieval. Users must then execute all notebook cells sequentially to retrieve and process live threat data, visualize cybersecurity threat statistics, train the machine learning model, and receive email notifications for high-risk threats. The system automatically saves processed data to a CSV file in Google Drive, ensuring that threat intelligence reports are readily available for further analysis and auditing.

## Evaluation
The Cybersecurity Threat Analysis System has several strengths. The implementation of automated threat detection significantly reduces reliance on manual monitoring, allowing security teams to focus on more strategic tasks. The machine learning predictions enhance cybersecurity decision-making by identifying threats based on real-world abuse reports. Additionally, the system’s proactive alerting function provides security administrators with immediate notifications when high-confidence threats are detected. The scalability of the system allows for easy integration with additional APIs, such as Shodan or VirusTotal, to improve data coverage. The design of the system ensures that it remains user-friendly, as it runs in Google Colab without requiring complex local installations.

Despite these advantages, the system has several limitations that should be considered. The reliance on a single data source, the AbuseIPDB API, may limit the system’s ability to capture new and evolving cyber threats that are not yet recorded in the database. The machine learning model, while effective, requires more diverse training data to improve accuracy and reduce potential overfitting. Another limitation is the system’s manual execution requirement, which means users must actively run the notebook rather than having it operate as a real-time monitoring service. Additionally, the system lacks a dedicated web-based interface, which could enhance accessibility for non-technical users.
