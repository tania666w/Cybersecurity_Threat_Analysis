# Cybersecurity Threat Analysis System

## Introduction
In an increasingly digital world, cybersecurity threats have become a significant concern for individuals, organizations, and governments. The rapid expansion of internet-connected devices and cloud-based systems has made it easier for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities. Organizations are often targeted by malicious actors attempting to breach systems, steal data, or disrupt operations. Consequently, robust threat detection and mitigation mechanisms are essential for maintaining security and reducing risk.
This report presents a Cybersecurity Threat Analysis System, a data-driven project designed to monitor, analyze, and predict security threats based on real-time threat intelligence data. The system integrates data from the AbuseIPDB API, processes the retrieved data using Python-based analytical tools, applies machine learning techniques to classify potentially malicious IPs, and provides real-time alerts for high-risk threats. This project follows structured software engineering practices, including Agile development, GitHub version control, and a systematic evaluation of strengths and limitations to enhance cybersecurity monitoring.

The following sections provide a comprehensive analysis of the system, including its features, technical implementation, development approach, and evaluation.

## System Features and Implementation
The Cybersecurity Threat Analysis System is designed to facilitate automated monitoring of security threats. The system collects live threat intelligence from the AbuseIPDB API, a widely used database for tracking malicious IP addresses. The data is processed and analyzed using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to generate meaningful insights and visualizations that can aid security teams in understanding trends in cyber threats. Machine learning is applied through a Random Forest Classifier, which predicts the likelihood of an IP being malicious based on historical threat reports. The system is also equipped with an automated alerting mechanism that notifies security administrators when a high-risk IP is detected. The processed data is stored and exported to Google Drive for future review and analysis. The entire development process is managed using GitHub, ensuring structured version control and project tracking.

## Technical Implementation
The system was built using Python and executed within a Jupyter Notebook environment via Google Colab to ensure accessibility and ease of use. API integration was implemented using Python’s Requests library to fetch data from the AbuseIPDB API. The retrieved data is stored in Pandas DataFrames, which enable efficient data handling and processing. Seaborn and Matplotlib are used to create statistical charts and reports to illustrate cybersecurity threat trends. Machine learning is integrated using Scikit-learn, where a Random Forest Classifier is trained to predict potential security risks based on reported abuse history. The system also includes an email alerting function configured using SMTP, allowing security teams to receive notifications in real time when a high-risk threat is detected.

## Project Planning and Agile Methodology
The project followed an Agile development methodology to ensure iterative progress and continuous improvements. The GitHub Projects tool was used to manage the workflow. The first sprint involved researching cybersecurity intelligence sources, selecting an API, and setting up the initial project environment. The second sprint focused on developing the Jupyter Notebook scripts necessary for retrieving and visualizing threat data. The third sprint involved implementing and testing the machine learning model for automated threat classification. The final sprint covered system evaluation, optimization, documentation, and submission preparation. Each major feature was tracked through GitHub Issues, ensuring proper version control and facilitating smooth development. Regular code commits and pull requests ensured that the repository maintained a structured and logical development history.

## Running the Cybersecurity Threat Analysis System
To run the project in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook, users must download the cybersecurity_data_product.ipynb file from the public GitHub repository link: https://github.com/tania666w/Cybersecurity_Threat_Analysis and open it in their preferred environment. To install the required dependencies, users should run the command !pip install requests pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn to ensure that all necessary Python packages are available. Before execution, users must configure an AbuseIPDB API key, which can be obtained from the AbuseIPDB API Dashboard. This key should be entered into the script to enable real-time threat intelligence retrieval. Users must then execute all notebook cells sequentially to retrieve and process live threat data, visualize cybersecurity threat statistics, train the machine learning model, and receive email notifications for high-risk threats. The system automatically saves processed data to a CSV file in Google Drive, ensuring that threat intelligence reports are readily available for further analysis and auditing.

## Evaluation
The Cybersecurity Threat Analysis System has several strengths. The implementation of automated threat detection significantly reduces reliance on manual monitoring, allowing security teams to focus on more strategic tasks. The machine learning predictions enhance cybersecurity decision-making by identifying threats based on real-world abuse reports. Additionally, the system’s proactive alerting function provides security administrators with immediate notifications when high-confidence threats are detected. The scalability of the system allows for easy integration with additional APIs, such as Shodan or VirusTotal, to improve data coverage. The design of the system ensures that it remains user-friendly, as it runs in Google Colab without requiring complex local installations.

Despite these advantages, the system has several limitations that should be considered. The reliance on a single data source, the AbuseIPDB API, may limit the system’s ability to capture new and evolving cyber threats that are not yet recorded in the database. The machine learning model, while effective, requires more diverse training data to improve accuracy and reduce potential overfitting. Another limitation is the system’s manual execution requirement, which means users must actively run the notebook rather than having it operate as a real-time monitoring service. Additionally, the system lacks a dedicated web-based interface, which could enhance accessibility for non-technical users.

Several future enhancements could improve the effectiveness of the system. Integrating multiple threat intelligence sources would provide a more comprehensive dataset for threat classification, increasing the accuracy of predictions. Enhancing the machine learning model by training it with a broader dataset could improve its ability to detect previously unknown threats. Automating the system to enable scheduled execution would transform it into a real-time cybersecurity monitoring tool. Developing a web-based dashboard using Streamlit or Voila would make the system more user-friendly and accessible to a wider audience, ensuring that security teams can interact with data more efficiently.

## GitHub Repository and Version Control
This project is hosted on GitHub to ensure structured version control and track software development progress. The repository includes structured commits and branches to maintain a clear development history. GitHub Issues were used to document feature requests, bug tracking, and overall project progress. The use of GitHub Actions is a potential future implementation that could allow for automated testing and CI/CD workflows, improving the reliability and maintainability of the system. The complete project can be accessed at the GitHub Repository SecureTrack.

## Conclusion
The Cybersecurity Threat Analysis System successfully integrates real-time threat intelligence with machine learning to provide a proactive cybersecurity solution. By leveraging data analytics and automation, this project demonstrates an effective approach to identifying and mitigating cyber threats. The adoption of Agile methodologies and GitHub version control ensures that development remains structured and iterative. While the current system provides immediate benefits in threat monitoring and classification, further enhancements are necessary to improve its real-world applications. The addition of automation, expanded data sources, and web-based visualization tools will significantly improve the system’s usability and scalability. This project serves as a strong foundation for future cybersecurity initiatives and advanced threat intelligence research.
